**Segments**

- **By Technology:** The molecular imaging market is segmented based on technology into PET, SPECT, MRI, CT, optical imaging, ultrasound, and others. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a commonly used technology for molecular imaging, providing detailed information about the functioning of organs and tissues at a molecular level. Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is another essential technology that uses radiotracers to detect gamma rays emitted by the radioactive substances. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides high-resolution images of internal body structures using a magnetic field and radio waves. Computed Tomography (CT) scans combine X-rays with computer technology to produce detailed cross-sectional images of the body. Optical imaging uses light to capture molecular and cellular events in living organisms, offering real-time visualization of biological processes. Ultrasound imaging uses high-frequency sound waves to produce internal images of the body's organs.

- **By Application:** The market can be segmented based on application into cardiology, oncology, neurology, respiratory, orthopedics, and others. In cardiology, molecular imaging is used for the early detection of heart diseases and assessment of heart function. Oncology applications involve the detection and monitoring of cancer using molecular imaging techniques to guide treatment decisions. Neurology applications include studying brain functions, detecting neurological disorders, and monitoring treatment responses. Respiratory imaging is essential for diagnosing respiratory conditions and studying lung diseases. Orthopedic applications involve imaging bone and joint structures for diagnostic purposes and treatment planning.

- **By End-User:** The molecular imaging market is segmented by end-user into hospitals, diagnostic imaging centers, research institutes, and others.
