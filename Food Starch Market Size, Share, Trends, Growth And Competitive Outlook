**Segments**

- **Source:** Food starch can be derived from various sources such as corn, wheat, potato, and others. Each source has its own unique properties and applications in the food industry. Corn starch, for example, is widely used as a thickening agent in sauces and soups due to its neutral flavor and excellent texture. Potato starch, on the other hand, is valued for its clarity and gelling properties, making it ideal for use in dairy products and meat applications. Wheat starch is commonly used in baking and as a coating for fried foods.

- **Type:** Food starch comes in different types such as native starch, modified starch, and sweeteners. Native starch is the most basic form of food starch, directly extracted from the source without any chemical modification. Modified starch, on the other hand, undergoes physical or chemical alterations to improve its functional properties such as stability, texture, and resistance to high temperatures. Sweeteners derived from food starch, like glucose syrup and maltodextrin, are often used as substitutes for sugar in various food products.

- **Application:** Food starch finds applications across a wide range of industries, including bakery, confectionery, beverages, and processed foods. In the bakery sector, starch is used as a thickener in fillings and toppings, as well as a binding agent in gluten-free products. In confectionery, starch is utilized for its gelling properties in gummy candies and as a dusting agent to prevent clumping. In the beverage industry, starch is used to stabilize emulsions and improve mouthfeel in products like smoothies and dairy-based drinks.
