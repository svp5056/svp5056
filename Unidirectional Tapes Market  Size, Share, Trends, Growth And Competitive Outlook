**Segments**

- Fiber Type: The unidirectional tapes market can be segmented based on the type of fibers used in the tapes, such as carbon fiber, glass fiber, aramid fiber, and others. Carbon fiber unidirectional tapes are known for their high strength-to-weight ratio and are often used in aerospace and automotive applications. Glass fiber tapes, on the other hand, are valued for their low cost and good resistance to corrosion.

- Resin Type: Another important segment in the unidirectional tapes market is based on the type of resin used to impregnate the fibers. Common resin types include epoxy, thermoplastic, and others. Epoxy resin is popular for its high strength and durability, making it suitable for structural applications. Thermoplastic resin offers benefits such as easy recyclability and rapid processing, making it attractive in certain industries.

- End-Use Industry: The market for unidirectional tapes can also be segmented by end-use industries, including aerospace, automotive, sports and leisure, wind energy, and others. Each industry has unique requirements for strength, weight, and performance, leading to specific preferences for fiber and resin combinations in the unidirectional tapes used.
