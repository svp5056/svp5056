- **Material Segment**: The material segmentation of the global safety valve market plays a critical role in determining the suitability of valves for different industrial applications. Steel safety valves are preferred for their durability and corrosion resistance, making them ideal for harsh industrial environments where reliability is paramount. Alloy safety valves offer a balance between strength and cost-effectiveness, catering to industries with specific material requirements. Cast iron safety valves are known for their high-temperature capabilities, making them suitable for applications where heat resistance is essential. Cryogenic safety valves are designed to withstand extreme low temperatures, commonly used in industries such as aerospace and healthcare. Other materials, such as stainless steel, titanium, or nickel alloys, provide diverse options for specialized industrial needs.

- **Size Segment**: The size segmentation of safety valves categorizes them based on their nominal pipe size, which directly influences their flow capacity and pressure rating. Valves with a size of less than 1"" are often used in compact systems or low-pressure applications where space efficiency is crucial. Safety valves ranging from 1"" to 10"" are versatile options suitable for a wide range of industrial processes, providing reliable pressure relief in moderate to high-pressure systems. Valves sized between 11"" to 20"" cater to larger industrial setups requiring enhanced flow control and pressure management capabilities. Valves of 20"" and above are heavy-duty solutions designed for high-pressure applications in critical industries such as oil & gas, petrochemicals, and power generation
