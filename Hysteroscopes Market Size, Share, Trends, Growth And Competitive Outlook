**Segments**

- Based on type, the hysteroscopes market can be segmented into rigid hysteroscopes and flexible hysteroscopes. Rigid hysteroscopes consist of a long, narrow tube with a light and camera at one end, allowing for direct visualization of the uterine cavity. On the other hand, flexible hysteroscopes are designed to navigate the tortuous anatomy of the uterus more easily, offering greater flexibility during procedures. Both types play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating various gynecological conditions effectively.

- From the perspective of application, the hysteroscopes market can be categorized into diagnostic hysteroscopy and operative hysteroscopy. Diagnostic hysteroscopy involves the visual examination of the uterine cavity to identify any abnormalities or issues such as fibroids, polyps, or adhesions. Operative hysteroscopy, on the other hand, allows for surgical interventions to be performed directly within the uterus, such as removing polyps or fibroids, addressing intrauterine adhesions, or conducting endometrial ablation procedures.

- In terms of end-users, the hysteroscopes market is segmented into hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and specialty clinics. Hospitals are the primary end-users of hysteroscopes due to the high volume of gynecological procedures performed in these settings. Ambulatory surgical centers are gaining popularity for hysteroscopy procedures due to their cost-effectiveness and convenience, while specialty clinics cater to specific gynecological services, including hysteroscopy examinations and treatments.
