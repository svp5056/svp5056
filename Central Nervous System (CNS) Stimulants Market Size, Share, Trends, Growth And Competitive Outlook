Methylphenidates, like Ritalin and Concerta, are also used to treat ADHD and have similar mechanisms of action to amphetamines but with slightly different side effect profiles. Non-amphetamines, including medications like Provigil and Nuvigil, are often prescribed for conditions like shift work sleep disorder and obstructive sleep apnea. The ""others"" category may include emerging CNS stimulants that are still under development or less commonly used in clinical practice.

- By Application: The market for CNS stimulants can be further segmented based on applications such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, sleep disorders, and cognitive enhancement. ADHD is a prominent indication for CNS stimulants, with a high prevalence in both children and adults. Narcolepsy, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden loss of muscle tone, is another key application area for CNS stimulants. Sleep disorders, including shift work sleep disorder and obstructive sleep apnea, also drive demand for stimulant medications.
