- **Raw Material**: The raw material segment of the global stretch blow molding machine market includes polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and others. Each raw material has its specific characteristics and applications in the manufacturing of bottles and containers. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is widely used in the packaging industry due to its transparency, lightweight, and recyclability, making it a popular choice for beverage and personal care products. Polypropylene is known for its durability and chemical resistance, making it suitable for industrial packaging and healthcare products.

- **Technology Type**: The technology segment of the market comprises single-step and two-step machines. Single-step machines integrate preform heating and bottle blowing into a single process, offering faster production cycles and higher energy efficiency. On the other hand, two-step machines separate preform production and bottle blowing stages, providing more flexibility in terms of bottle design and material handling. The choice of technology depends on factors such as production volume, bottle size, and customization requirements.

- **Product Type**: Stretch blow molding machines are classified into automatic and semi-automatic types based on their operational capabilities. Automatic machines offer fully automated production processes, including preform loading, heating, and bottle ejection, suitable for high-volume production lines. In contrast, semi-automatic machines require manual intervention for certain stages of the process, providing more control over production variables and lower initial investment costs.
