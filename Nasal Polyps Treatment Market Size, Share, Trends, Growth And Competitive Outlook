The nasal polyps treatmentThe nasal polyps treatment market continues to witness significant growth due to the increasing prevalence of nasal polyps globally. The market segmentation based on type, route of administration, and end user allows for a more targeted approach in addressing the diverse needs of patients. Corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics each play a crucial role in managing nasal polyps by targeting inflammation and immune responses at the molecular level. Corticosteroids are the go-to treatment for reducing inflammation, while immunomodulators work by modulating the immune system to reduce polyp growth. The introduction of biologics has brought about a new era in nasal polyps treatment, offering targeted therapies that address specific molecules involved in the inflammatory process.
