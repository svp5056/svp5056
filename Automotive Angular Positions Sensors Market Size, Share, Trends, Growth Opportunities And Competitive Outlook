**Segments**

- Based on type, the automotive angular position sensors market can be segmented into resistive sensors, inductive sensors, Hall-effect sensors, and others. Resistive sensors are cost-effective but less robust compared to the Hall-effect sensors which provide more accurate measurements. Inductive sensors offer high reliability and durability, making them suitable for harsh operating conditions in automotive applications.

- By vehicle type, the market can be categorized into passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, and heavy commercial vehicles. Passenger cars constitute a significant share due to the high adoption rate of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in modern vehicles. Light commercial vehicles are also witnessing growth with the increasing demand for telematics and safety features.

- On the basis of application, the automotive angular position sensors market is segmented into throttle position sensing, pedal position sensing, gear position sensing, steering angle sensing, and others. Throttle position sensors monitor the position of the throttle valve, while gear position sensors help in gear shifting for optimized performance. Steering angle sensors are crucial for stability control systems in vehicles.
