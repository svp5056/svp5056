**Segments**

- **Product Type**: The fracking chemicals market can be segmented based on product type into gelling agents, friction reducers, corrosion & scale inhibitors, surfactants, biocides, gelling agents, and others. Gelling agents are crucial in hydraulic fracking as they help in the transportation of proppants into the fractures created. Friction reducers aid in minimizing the frictional pressure during the fracking process. Corrosion & scale inhibitors are used to protect the equipment and infrastructure from corrosion and scaling. Surfactants help in reducing the surface tension between water and oil. Biocides are essential for controlling bacteria growth in the fracturing fluid.

- **Application**: The market for fracking chemicals can also be segmented by application, including areas such as shale gas, tight gas, coalbed methane, and others. Shale gas extraction is one of the significant applications of fracking chemicals due to the increasing focus on unconventional gas sources.
