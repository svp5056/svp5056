**Segments**

- Based on biomaterials, the artificial tendons and ligaments market can be segmented into polymer-based artificial tendons and ligaments, carbon-based artificial tendons and ligaments, and metal-based artificial tendons and ligaments. Polymer-based artificial tendons and ligaments are anticipated to dominate the market due to their widespread use in surgical procedures for tendon and ligament repair. The versatility and biocompatibility of polymer-based materials make them a popular choice among surgeons and patients alike. Carbon-based artificial tendons and ligaments are also gaining traction in the market, especially in sports medicine applications where high strength and durability are crucial. Metal-based artificial tendons and ligaments, though less common, are utilized in specific cases where a higher level of mechanical support is required.

- By application, the artificial tendons and ligaments market can be categorized into shoulder injuries, knee injuries, foot and ankle injuries, and others. Knee injuries make up a significant portion of the market share, attributed to the high prevalence of conditions such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears that often require surgical intervention. Shoulder injuries are also a key segment, driven by factors such as increasing participation in sports activities and age-related degenerative conditions affecting the shoulder joint. Foot and ankle injuries represent a niche segment within the market, but advancements in artificial tendon and ligament technologies are expanding the treatment options available for these conditions.
