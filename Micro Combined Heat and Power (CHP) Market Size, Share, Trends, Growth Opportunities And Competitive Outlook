**Segments**

- **Type**: The Micro Combined Heat and Power (CHP) market can be segmented based on type into engine-based CHP systems, fuel cell-based CHP systems, and others. Engine-based CHP systems are widely used due to their efficiency and operational flexibility. Fuel cell-based CHP systems, although more expensive, are gaining popularity due to their lower emission levels and quieter operation.

- **Application**: The market can also be segmented based on application, including residential, commercial, and industrial. The residential segment is witnessing significant growth due to increasing energy efficiency requirements and rising energy costs. The commercial sector is adopting micro CHP systems for cost savings and environmental sustainability. The industrial segment is looking towards these systems to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon footprints.

- **Fuel Type**: Another key segmentation is based on fuel type, which includes natural gas, propane, biogas, and others. Natural gas is the most commonly used fuel for micro CHP systems due to its availability, cost-effectiveness, and low emissions. Propane-based systems offer flexibility for remote locations or areas without natural gas infrastructure. Biogas-based CHP systems are environmentally friendly and support circular economy principles.
