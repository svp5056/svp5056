**Segments**

- **Type**: The antimicrobial plastics market can be segmented based on the type of material, such as commodity plastics, engineering plastics, high-performance plastics, and others. Commodity plastics like polyethylene and polypropylene are widely used due to their cost-effectiveness, while engineering plastics such as ABS and PET offer better mechanical properties. High-performance plastics like PEEK and PTFE provide superior chemical resistance and durability.

- **Application**: Another important segmentation factor is the application of antimicrobial plastics. This includes segments like medical devices, packaging, consumer goods, automotive, building and construction, and others. Medical devices utilize antimicrobial plastics to prevent infections, while packaging industries use them for food preservation. The automotive sector benefits from antimicrobial plastics for interior components, and the building and construction sector employs them for hygiene and cleanliness purposes.

- **Additives**: Antimicrobial plastics can also be segmented based on the type of additives incorporated. These additives include organic additives (such as silver, copper, and zinc-based) and inorganic additives (such as metal oxides and salts). Organic additives are preferred for their effectiveness against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, while inorganic additives offer longer-lasting antimicrobial properties.
