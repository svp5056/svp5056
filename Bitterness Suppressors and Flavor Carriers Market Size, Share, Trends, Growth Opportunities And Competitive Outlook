Bitterness suppressors and flavor carriers are critical components in the food and beverage industry. Bitterness suppressors are further segmented into bitter blockers, which work by interacting with bitter compounds to reduce their perception; bitter maskers, which mask the bitter taste with other flavors; and bitter binders, which bind to bitter compounds and reduce their solubility. On the other hand, flavor carriers play a vital role in ensuring the stability and delivery of flavors in food products. The different techniques used in flavor carriers include encapsulation, which involves the coating of flavor molecules for controlled release; microencapsulation, which encapsulates flavors in small particles; nanoencapsulation, which is similar to microencapsulation on a nano-scale; coacervation, a process of phase separation; and spray drying, a method to create powdered flavors for better solubility.
